Tower Wars

An entry for MiniLD #8 <http://ludumdare.com/compo/category/minild/minild-8>

The theme for this competiton is "Mash-Up"

This is my first entry into any of the Ludum Dare competitions.  As I'm a
newcomer here, I don't really know much about the games that have been entered
before.  Therefore, instead of picking two specific games, I've decided to pick
several previous themes and try to make a game that fits all of them.

So, the themes I've chosen:

  LD2:  Construction/Destruction
  LD10: Chain Reaction
  LD12: The Tower

And, depending on how much you're willing to stretch the theme:

  LD0:  Indirect Interaction

The idea is to have two players competing with each other to build a tower to a
specified height.  (Possibly one and an AI, but I think multiplayer will be
easier to get right.)  There will be opportunities for each player to sabotage
the other's tower-in-construction.
